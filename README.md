# Team Step MI-Band App

Android Studio project for Team Step

This project is built using a MVC architecture and collects information via BLE bluetooth from multiple mi-bands for research purposes. It uses a modified [mi-band-sdk](https://github.com/pangliang/miband-sdk-android) to collect activity data from multiple devices.
